# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
> ##Foundations - Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms.

### General

* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
* How to build and use linked lists

### Linked List

The Linked List allow us represent a group of elements presented as a sequence.

### Advantage of the Linked List against to an array.

* The arrays is stored the information in the memory in a sequential manner in the nodes don't have to save all together in memory.
* The linked list can have variable length.
* The linked list can add and remove elements in runtime.

### Disadvantage of the Linked List against to an array.

* The Linked list don't have index, so we can't do ramdom access to the elements.
* I need more space in the memory because not only you're going to keep a value but also the pointer of a node.
